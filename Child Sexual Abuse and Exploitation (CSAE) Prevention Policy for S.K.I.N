1. Zero Tolerance for CSAE Content
Strict Prohibition of CSAE Content: S.K.I.N has a zero-tolerance policy for any form of Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE), including child sexual abuse material, exploitation, trafficking, or any other harmful content involving minors. Any CSAE-related content found on the platform will be immediately removed, and the responsible admin or user will face account suspension or termination.

Admin-Controlled Posts: Since only admins are allowed to post content, the risk of inappropriate material being shared is minimized. However, super admins have oversight to ensure all content stays within the boundaries of job-related postings.

2. Super Admin Oversight and Control
Super Admin Role: The super admin is responsible for monitoring all content on the platform and ensuring that the posts remain relevant to job openings and recruitment. Super admins have full control over the platform's content and can take corrective actions when necessary.

Blocking and Freezing Admins: If an admin posts content that is irrelevant, inappropriate, or violates S.K.I.N's policies (including CSAE guidelines), the super admin has the authority to:

Block the admin, freezing their ability to post any further content.

Review and delete any irrelevant or harmful posts made by the admin.

Content Review and Deletion: Super admins are empowered to delete any content that does not meet the platform's standards, including recruitment-related content or job postings that violate the CSAE Prevention Policy. This ensures that only professional, job-related discussions are allowed on the platform.

3. Preventing CSAE through Active Monitoring
Super Admin Monitoring Tools: Super admins have access to advanced monitoring tools that allow them to:

Review all admin posts and content shared in the chat.

Identify and remove any posts that do not align with S.K.I.N's mission of job recruitment.

Monitor for potential CSAE violations, using both automated tools and human oversight to detect inappropriate content.

Proactive Action: Super admins are trained to recognize CSAE risks and are expected to take immediate action if CSAE-related content is found, including blocking the responsible admin and reporting to law enforcement as required.

4. No Reporting Feature but Block and Freeze Options
No Reporting Feature: Since there is no direct reporting feature from users, S.K.I.N relies on super admins to proactively monitor and manage content. Any CSAE violations or irrelevant posts will be detected and managed by the super admin team before they impact users.

Block and Freeze Actions: Super admins can take immediate action to block or freeze an admin's ability to post if they breach the platform’s guidelines. This functionality ensures that content that violates CSAE policies or deviates from the recruitment focus is swiftly dealt with.

Freezing Admin Actions: When an admin’s actions are frozen, they are unable to post, edit, or engage with the chat until their status is reviewed and restored by the super admin. This process ensures that only compliant and relevant content is shared.

5. Age Verification and User Privacy
Age Verification: All users must verify their age during registration. This step ensures that minors are protected from harmful content and prevents them from accessing the platform without proper safeguards.

Parental Consent for Minors Under 13: In compliance with COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) and similar laws in other regions, users under 13 (or the legal age in their country) must obtain parental consent before using S.K.I.N.

No Personal Information Sharing: Users are prohibited from sharing personal information in the chat, including phone numbers, home addresses, or email addresses. This policy helps minimize the risk of exploitation or CSAE-related interactions.

6. Admin Accountability and Training
Admin Role and Accountability: Admins are responsible for ensuring that their posts are professional, relevant to job openings, and comply with all CSAE guidelines. Super admins monitor and review admin posts regularly to ensure compliance with platform standards.

Training for Admins: All admins undergo mandatory training to understand the platform’s CSAE Prevention Policy, learn how to post appropriate job content, and become familiar with reporting procedures in case of a CSAE violation.

Background Checks for Admins: Admins are subject to background checks to ensure they have no history of involvement in harmful activities, including CSAE-related offenses, before they are granted posting privileges.

7. Data Protection and Privacy
Minimal Data Collection: S.K.I.N collects only essential information for user registration and functionality. We ensure that user data is handled securely and that sensitive information is protected.

Compliance with Privacy Regulations: S.K.I.N adheres to all relevant privacy laws, including GDPR and COPPA, to ensure that all personal data is stored and processed securely.

Encrypted Communication: All communications within the app are encrypted to ensure that no personal or sensitive information is exposed.

8. Continuous Monitoring and Policy Updates
Ongoing Monitoring and Updates: S.K.I.N continually updates its CSAE Prevention Policy to stay aligned with new regulations, emerging threats, and best practices in online safety. Super admins play a key role in ensuring that the platform remains a safe and secure environment for users.

Review of Content: Super admins are expected to regularly audit the content being posted on the platform, ensuring that no irrelevant or harmful material is shared. Any inappropriate content will be swiftly removed, and the admin responsible will be subject to disciplinary action.
